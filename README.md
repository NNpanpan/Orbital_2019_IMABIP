Want to try out a new sport but does't know anyone with the same thoughts?
Alone or not have enough players? 
Already have enough players, but tired of the hassles of organizing your game?
Tired of searching through different websites/channels to compare venues?

We aim to build an app which serves as a convenient and accesible platform for NUS students to book sport venues, join strangers' games and even create their own game.

User Stories:
1. As a sport enthusiast but can't find enough players to play a team sport, I want to be able to join games organized by other people that are located near me.
2. As a team manager for a sports team, I want to be able to find formed teams to have friendly games.
3. As a person who just started picking up on some kind of sport, I want to be able to play with other players casually.
4. As an organizer for a casual game amongst my friends, I want to be able to compare and book the venue of my choice with ease.
